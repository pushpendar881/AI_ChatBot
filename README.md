# AI_ChatBot
This project is a conversational chatbot capable of understanding both text and images, making it versatile for a range of user interactions. Built with **Mistral** for language processing and **BLIP** for image feature extraction, the chatbot can interpret questions based on both visual and text inputs.

## Project Overview
- **Purpose**: To create a chatbot that can respond to questions in context, using not only text but also visual data.
- **Core Technology**: Combines two advanced models from Hugging Face:
  - **Mistral**: A language model providing high-quality responses to text-based queries.
  - **BLIP**: Used for extracting features from images, allowing the chatbot to include image context in its answers.

## Key Features
1. **Text Interpretation**: Mistral processes natural language input, enabling nuanced and contextually relevant responses.
2. **Image Understanding**: BLIP analyzes uploaded images, adding a layer of context for responses that integrate both visual and text data.
3. **Multi-modal Interaction**: Users can engage with the chatbot by asking questions directly or by including images for deeper context.

## How It Works
- **Data Flow**:
  1. **Image Input**: Users can upload images, which are then processed by BLIP to extract features and context.
  2. **Text Input**: Questions and instructions are handled by Mistral, which interprets language and applies any visual context when available.
  3. **Response Generation**: The chatbot combines insights from text and image inputs, crafting a response that is enriched by both language and visual understanding.

## Use Cases
- **Customer Support**: Helps users by answering questions with both text and images (e.g., product images or instructional visuals).
- **Educational Assistance**: Can respond to questions based on visual material (e.g., diagrams, maps, or reference images).
- **General Knowledge and Q&A**: Users can ask anything, enhancing conversations with related images when available.

## Future Plans
- **Further Model Fine-Tuning**: Adjust Mistral and BLIP for improved results with specific types of content.
- **Deployment**: The next steps include deploying this chatbot online, making it accessible for public use.
